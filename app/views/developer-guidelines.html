        Developer guidelines
      </h1>
      <p>To help achieve the successful development of your application, when using the Companies House API you should adhere to a few simple guidelines:

      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
        Data resources

      </h2>
      <p>Data is mostly returned as JSON documents. Your application must tolerate the order of document members changing over time, and expect to receive members it hasn't seen before.
      </p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
        Security
      </h2>
      <p>The API can only be accessed over TLS. We recommend using TLS 1.2.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Securing API keys</h2>
      <p>It is important to keep your API keys secure, to prevent them being discovered, your account being compromised and your rate-limit quota being exceeded. There are a few best practices that can help with this:
      </p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-l">Do not embed API keys in your code</h3>
      <p>Storing keys in your application code increases the risk that they will be discovered, particularly if any of your source code is made public, or can be viewed by people who should not have access to the key. Instead, you should consider storing
        them inside environment variables or configuration.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-l">Do not store API keys in your source tree</h3>
      <p>If you store API keys in files, perhaps inside a configuration or environment file, these should not be stored inside the application source tree, just in case part or all of the source is made public or can be viewed by people who should not have
        access to the key.

      </p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-l">Restrict API key use by IP address and domain</h3>
      <p>Limiting the use of a key to a specific IP address or domain will reduce the usefulness of a key that becomes compromised.
      </p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-l">Regenerate your API keys</h3>
      <p>By regenerating your API keys regularly, and certainly with each application release, you can lessen the chance that a key will be discovered.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-l">Delete API keys when no longer required</h3>
      <p>Removing obsolete keys from your Developer Hub registered-applications page limits the number of entry points into your account.</p>
